                Where would you be without your friends/family and the <a class="font-bold em">experiences</a> they provided you?

            <div class="mb-4 mx-6">
                We didn’t like the answer either and so we set out to ensure that no child in Chicago had to live with that reality. Through our partnerships with various Chicago-based charitable foundations and local companies, we hope to raise awareness of that reality while working to change it.

                Our Goal?
            </div>
            
            <div class="mb-4 mx-6">
                Simple math. Each week, you spend hard-earned money on food, drinks and entertainment. We work with popular Chicago venues ahead of time to make those dollars you’re already spending on a night out go a little bit further. Far enough to help the kids throughout Chicago who aren’t as fortunate.

                Who Benefits?
            </div>

            <div class="mb-4 mx-6">
                Each event will support one foundation out of a select group of foundations working to provide the children of Chicago with the support and experiences many of us take for granted. The admission to each event will be donated to this group while also covering your drinks and food. The underlying theme for each event will be a clothes/toy drive geared towards the time of year, i.e. back to school supplies for an end of summer event.</li>
